## 📖 Overview

**MedSync** is a smart medication adherence system that integrates a **mobile application** with a **physical Medical Box device**, designed to work together through real-time synchronization to support patients in managing their medication routines.

The system allows users to **schedule medication alarms** through the mobile application, which are then synced to the Medical Box so it can trigger **physical alerts and notifications**, ensuring patients are consistently reminded to take their medicines on time.

This project was initially developed as part of our **research initiative** and is currently being further enhanced and maintained as a **freelance project** by the group.
